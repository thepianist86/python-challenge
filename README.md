Repository contains two sets of code and related resources and analysis:

*PyBank
Processes a CSV file of dates and related profits/losses, analyzing the total number of months being examined, the net total of the profits/losses, the average change, and finds the instances of greatest increase and decrease. All results are then published to the terminal and to a text file in the 'analysis' folder.

*PyPoll
Processes a CSV file of voting information to find total number of votes logged, what candidates were on the ballot, how many votes and what percentage of votes each candidate received, and who the winner of the popular vote is.
